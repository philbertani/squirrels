NYC Central Park Squirrel Sightings

This repo has a lot of useful stuff.  A few methods for dealing with reading in local CSV files and parsing data.

Then it takes the data and sends it to Threejs for interative display in 3d. Notice how the text labels track the 3d motion?

The input is a file taken from the NYC data repository on squirrel sightings which has many columns - including Latitude and Longitude, which surprisingly remain within the bounds of Central Park except for a few stragglers.

Each solid spherical point which represents a squirrel sighting is surrounded by a transparent shell of color so that clusters of many squirrels naturally add up to be brighter after adding the transparent shells together.

Try toggling the shadow plane on and off.
